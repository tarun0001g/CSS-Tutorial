## 📚 About

I'm currently learning frontend web development, and this repository is dedicated to the **CSS projects** I'm building along the way.  

All the **HTML-only projects** I created earlier are already uploaded in a separate repository.

This CSS-focused repository includes various small and meaningful projects that demonstrate:

- CSS layout systems (Flexbox, Grid)
- Styling techniques
- Animations & transitions
- Responsive design
- Hover effects and more!

Here’s what I’m building my skills in:

- Writing clean and maintainable CSS
- Using Flexbox & Grid efficiently
